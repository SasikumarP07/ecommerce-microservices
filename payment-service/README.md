ðŸ’° Payment Flow
Client sends a PaymentRequestDTO containing order ID, payment method, and amount.

PaymentService validates and processes the payment.

A Payment entity is created with a PENDING status.

Based on the simulated outcome or integration (e.g., with Razorpay or Stripe in future), status is updated to SUCCESS or FAILED.

A PaymentResponseDTO is returned to the client with payment ID, status, and transaction time.

Payment details can be retrieved later by orderId.

-----
ðŸ§ª Testing
All core service logic is unit tested using Mockito and JUnit 5.

Edge cases such as duplicate payments or missing order ID are handled with meaningful exceptions.
