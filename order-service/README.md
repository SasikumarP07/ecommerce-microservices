1. A customer places an order through the **Order Service**.
2. The service fetches cart details from the **Cart Service**.
3. Product information is retrieved from the **Product Service**.
4. Stock availability is validated and reduced in the **Inventory Service**.
5. The order is saved in the database.
6. A notification request is sent to the **Notification Service** (e.g., order confirmation).
