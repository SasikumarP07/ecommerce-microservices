## 🔐 JWT Authentication Flow

1. Client sends a request with JWT token in `Authorization` header.
2. Gateway intercepts it using `JwtValidationFilter`.
3. Token is validated using `JwtUtil` (from `common_util` service).
4. If valid, the request proceeds to the appropriate service.
5. If invalid or missing, a `401 Unauthorized` is returned.
