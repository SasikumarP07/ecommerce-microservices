# 🛰️ Eureka Service - Service Discovery for E-commerce Microservices

The **Eureka Service** is a central **Service Discovery Server** in the E-commerce Microservices Architecture. It enables all other microservices to register themselves and discover other services without hardcoding their network locations.

## 📦 Features

✅ Acts as a registry for all microservices  
✅ Enables dynamic service discovery  
✅ Reduces coupling between services  
✅ Supports load-balanced and failover-aware client communication  
✅ Web dashboard to view registered instances

## 🧱 Technologies Used

Java 17  
Spring Boot  
Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka  
Maven

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Eureka Server starts and listens for registration requests.
2. Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server using its `application.yml`.
3. Eureka maintains a registry of all live services.
4. Microservices can discover each other by service name using Eureka Client and LoadBalancer or Feign.

        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
